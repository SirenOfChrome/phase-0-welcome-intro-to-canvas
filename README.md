# Introduction To Canvas

Canvas is a learning platform used by universities and educational institutions
across the country and the world. Flatiron School uses Canvas to deliver all
curriculum content for your program.

Canvas is where all official Flatiron School communication, assignment
submission, grading, attendance, etc. will take place for the entirety of your
course. You should check Canvas multiple times a day for updates, announcements,
assignments, and the day's schedule. Canvas hosts many features which you will
become familiar with over the course of your time with Flatiron School. The
following lessons will introduce you to and explain some of the most important
functions. You can also download the Canvas app from the App Store.
